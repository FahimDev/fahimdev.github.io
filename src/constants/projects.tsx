            <p>
                ADPP is an Agri Digital Product Passport concept designed for Malik Seed to make agricultural sourcing, 
                quality control, certification, packaging, and supply-chain traceability more transparent and verifiable.
                The platform connects farm, hub, plant, QC, production, warehouse, and dispatch operations into a single
                traceability system.
            </p>

            <p>
                The proposed solution combines GS1/ISO-aligned data capture, batch and lot genealogy, offline QR-based
                operations, QC certificate verification, blockchain anchoring, and public verification pages. It is designed
                to support future readiness for GLOBALG.A.P., domestic certification bodies, exporters, retailers, and
                international compliance stakeholders.
            </p>

            <p>
                My contribution focused on shaping the product architecture, DPP positioning, blockchain certificate
                verification model, GS1 Digital Link strategy, ICP/L2 verification concept, role mapping, and portfolio-ready
                technical storytelling for client and CTO-level recommendation.

            title: "Conflicting Multi-Source Data for the Same Lot",

            challenge: {
                brief: "The same agricultural lot can produce different values from human, IoT, supplier, and system-generated sources.",
                detailed: "A single lot may enter the hub with a supplier-declared quantity of 30 kg, a hub operator may manually record 31 kg, while a connected weighing device independently captures 32 kg. Similar discrepancies can occur again at plant receiving, QC, processing, packaging, and warehouse stages. Treating one source as automatically correct would either discard useful evidence or create misleading traceability data."
            },

            solution: {
                brief: "Preserve every observation as independent evidence instead of overwriting conflicting values.",
                detailed: "ADPP is designed around an append-only evidence model where human entries, IoT readings, external-system records, QC observations, and operational events retain their own provenance, timestamp, source identity, measurement method, and supporting metadata. Adapters normalize these inputs into a common evidence format before they enter reconciliation."
            },

            impact: {
                brief: "Creates an auditable foundation for determining trusted data without losing the original evidence.",
                detailed: "The business can reconstruct exactly what each participant or device reported, while later reconciliation can determine the most defensible value using all available evidence instead of relying on the latest database entry."
            }
        },

        {
            title: "Progressive Cross-Stage Reconciliation",

            challenge: {
                brief: "The most reliable interpretation of a disputed value may only become clear after later supply-chain stages provide additional evidence.",
                detailed: "A discrepancy detected at hub intake should not always be resolved immediately. Plant receiving, QC measurements, processing losses, packaged output, rejected quantity, waste, and warehouse records may provide stronger downstream evidence about what actually happened to the lot."
            },

            solution: {
                brief: "Designed a lifecycle evidence reconciliation model that can wait for downstream evidence before finalizing consensus.",
                detailed: "The proposed engine evaluates evidence progressively across hub, plant, QC, production, packaging, warehouse, and dispatch stages. Deterministic rules and mass-balance constraints can be combined with source reliability scoring, robust statistics, anomaly detection, and later probabilistic evidence-fusion approaches. A process/state model controls when a lot is collecting evidence, has detected conflicts, requires additional evidence, needs manual review, or is ready for consensus."
            },

            impact: {
                brief: "Improves the accuracy and defensibility of the final trusted record.",
                detailed: "Instead of prematurely selecting a value at each stage, ADPP can use the entire product journey to converge toward a canonical record and attach a confidence level to that conclusion."

            title: "Internal Audit vs. External Trusted Data",

            challenge: {
                brief: "Businesses need full visibility into conflicting evidence, while buyers and consumers need one clear and trustworthy representation.",
                detailed: "Showing every conflicting measurement to a buyer or consumer would create confusion and reduce trust. Hiding those inconsistencies from internal teams, however, would remove valuable evidence for identifying operational loss, faulty devices, repeated human errors, supplier discrepancies, or potential fraud."
            },

            solution: {
                brief: "Separated forensic audit output from the external consensus projection.",
                detailed: "ADPP maintains two views over the same evidence history. The internal audit view preserves discrepancies, anomalies, corrections, device and actor histories, and reconciliation reasoning for investigation. The external passport view exposes only the reconciled product data, QC status, traceability information, certificate status, and relevant confidence indicators."
            },

            impact: {
                brief: "Turns traceability data into both loss intelligence and buyer trust.",
                detailed: "Internal teams gain evidence for root-cause analysis, process improvement, device calibration, supplier assessment, and loss reduction, while distributors, buyers, auditors, and consumers receive a consistent and non-confusing trusted product record."

            title: "Digitally Verifiable QC & Compliance Credentials",

            challenge: {
                brief: "Traditional PDFs and uploaded certificates can be copied, modified, expired, revoked, or presented outside their original product context.",
                detailed: "A certificate file alone does not provide a machine-verifiable relationship between the issuing organization, the agricultural lot, the claims inside the certificate, and its current validity status. This becomes increasingly problematic when certificates need to be consumed by exporters, retailers, auditors, certification organizations, or automated compliance systems."
            },

            solution: {
                brief: "Designed W3C Verifiable Credential-style certificates with cryptographic issuer signing and blockchain anchoring.",
                detailed: "The backlog includes a W3C VC-style certificate builder, EIP-712 typed-data signing, EVM anchoring, public verification, and revocation/status handling. Certificate and evidence documents can remain off-chain, while cryptographic hashes, issuer proofs, event roots, timestamps, and status information are anchored on an L2 network. This separates the credential format from the blockchain trust anchor rather than treating blockchain itself as the certificate."
            },

            impact: {
                brief: "Creates a future-ready certificate verification layer for domestic and international agri ecosystems.",
                detailed: "The model can complement QC laboratories, certification bodies, exporters, retailers, GLOBALG.A.P.-related workflows, and other organizations by making their issued evidence easier to authenticate, verify, exchange, and connect with specific lots or product passports."

                brief: "Agricultural operations may capture critical evidence in locations with intermittent connectivity and heterogeneous devices.",
                detailed: "Hub, plant, QC, warehouse, and field users may depend on tablets, mobile devices, weighing machines, sensors, manual measurements, and external systems. Network interruptions can create duplicate submissions, missing records, synchronization conflicts, or uncertainty about whether a measurement was successfully transmitted."
            },

            solution: {
                brief: "Designed offline-first event capture with retry safety, deduplication, device integration, and tamper-evident records.",
                detailed: "The proposed platform uses an append-only local event queue, idempotent synchronization, server acknowledgements, conflict handling, duplication safeguards, operational QR handover, local signatures, hash-chain integrity, and IoT ingestion. Device adapters provide a common interface for measurements coming from heterogeneous equipment."
            },

            impact: {
                brief: "Makes the evidence model practical for real-world agricultural operations.",

                brief: "Planned account abstraction, gas sponsorship, relay infrastructure, and controlled production deployment.",

                    Hotelereum is a Web3-based Online Travel Agency (OTA) that transforms hotel reservations into NFT-backed digital assets — making them resellable, traceable, and interoperable across platforms.
        <br/>
                    Beyond bookings, Hotelereum operates as a global messaging and coordination system for the tourism and hospitality supply chain. Each smart contract acts as a single source of truth, 
                    securely transmitting token-based reservation data between hotels, OTAs, guests, and third-party service providers.

                    This project pioneers fully on-chain e-commerce on the DFINITY Internet Computer (ICP) network — where both frontend and backend live natively on-chain. Designed as a multi-tenant decentralized marketplace, it empowers multiple vendors to host isolated online stores, each running in its own dedicated canister backend for fault isolation and scalability.
            <br/>
                    Integrated with Internet Identity (II), users can securely log in without usernames or passwords, enjoying a single sign-on (SSO) experience across all participating vendor stores.
                    The result: a first-of-its-kind, self-scaling blockchain e-commerce ecosystem, blending decentralization, security, and real-world retail readiness.

When switching between these frontends, the general KYC information may not be mapped properly, as the principals will be unique.",

    //                 detailed: "The public ICP network had exposed canisters that were susceptible to spam attacks and unauthorized inter-canister calls. This created significant security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks, affecting the overall reliability of the system. The exposed nature of these canisters meant that malicious actors could potentially exploit them for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, leading to network congestion and service unavailability. Additionally, the lack of proper authentication mechanisms allowed unauthorized entities to make calls to critical system functions, potentially compromising data integrity and system security."

The registry maintains a whitelist of authorized canister principals and validates each call against this registry before execution. Additionally, deployed distributed scaling via subnet load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple subnets. This approach includes implementing rate limiting mechanisms, request throttling, and automatic failover capabilities to ensure system resilience under high load conditions."

    //                 detailed: "Users receive different principal addresses when they sign up with the same Internet Identity (II) across different frontends. The principal addresses are uniquely assigned as user UUIDs and tailored with frontend domain addresses for the same internet identity holder. Their Internet Identity Anchor Number will remain unchanged, but platform-specific principal IDs will differ. This creates a general KYC issue for dApps that have multiple frontend canisters, as when switching between these frontends, the general KYC information may not be mapped properly since the principals will be unique. This fragmentation of user identity across platforms leads to poor user experience and complex identity management."

    //                 detailed: "Creating multi-tenant vendor dApps that are automatically deployed to the ICP mainnet presents significant challenges. One major issue is that if a frontend canister is also dynamically deployed for each store, consumers will have to sign up for each store individually to obtain their principal address, leading to a poor shopping experience. Additionally, managing the lifecycle of these dynamically created canisters, ensuring proper resource allocation, and maintaining security isolation between different vendor stores requires sophisticated orchestration systems. The complexity increases with the need to handle updates, rollbacks, and monitoring across multiple dynamically created instances."
